    <p class="Paragraph">Real progress starts with good health. </p>
    <p class="Paragraph">We are fully committed to stopping the spread of serious infections, 
    fighting chronic illnesses, making sure that everyone—no matter who they are—can see a doctor when they need to.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">We believe quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a luxury for the lucky few.
    <p class="Paragraph">After all, you cannot have a healthy economy without healthy people.</p>

    <h2>By 2030, we are targeting specific milestones to transform global health:</h2>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Maternal & Child Health:</strong> Reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Fight Communicable Diseases:</strong> End the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, while combatting hepatitis and water-borne diseases.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Tackle Non-Communicable Diseases:</strong> Reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (like heart disease and diabetes) by one-third through prevention and treatment, and promote mental health and well-being.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Road Safety:</strong> Halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents.</p>

    <h1 class="Header">The Challenges We Face</h1>
    <h2>While we have made strides, 
    the world is currently off track to meet many of these targets by 2030</h2>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Progress is Too Slow:</strong> Although maternal mortality has declined, it is not dropping fast enough. 
    Nearly 800 women still die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Infectious Disease Threats:</strong> Tuberculosis cases are rising—2023 saw the highest number of new cases since monitoring began. 
    While HIV deaths have dropped, new infections are rising in several regions.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Vaccination Gaps:</strong> Childhood vaccination coverage has stagnated or dipped. 
    In 2021 alone, 25 million children missed out on routine immunizations.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Workforce Shortages:</strong> We face a projected global shortage of 10 million health workers by 2030, 
    with the most critical gaps in low-income countries.</p>
</section>
<section id="preventions">
    <h1 class="Header">Prevention is Better Than Cure</h1>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Invest in Health Systems:</strong> Governments must invest substantially in recruiting, 
    training, and retaining health workers.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Commit to UHC:</strong> We must accelerate efforts toward Universal Health Coverage
    to ensure that financial status does not dictate health outcomes.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Restore Immunization:</strong> We need immediate action to bring vaccination rates back to pre-pandemic
    levels and ensure no child is missed.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"><strong>Research & Development:</strong> We must continue to support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for diseases 
    that primarily affect developing countries</p>
